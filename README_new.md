### Design pattern

lib/notion is **Directory** with **File Method **
E.g: - filterSomething - getSomething - deleteSomething - setSomething

From each method file would export default same method name

And notion.js is contractor where understand which is public which is not. 
All API of notions would managed from notion.js
